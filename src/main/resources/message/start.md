If you are the first-time user, let's go through the next simple steps to get started
  
  *Set your currency*
  The default currency is Euro. 
To change it, send me `/` followed by [currency code](https://www.iban.com/currency-codes)
  
  Example: `/usd`
  
  *Add some expenses*
  Let's say your currency is Euro. 
Now, you ordered one coffee for one euro. 
To save this, 
  
  send me `/1`
  
  Then you offered cappuccino to your friend and paid 1.50 euro. 
To save this, 
  
  send `/1.50`
  _Note: for decimal expenses, put both digits after '.'_
  
  After that, you bought some mobile app and paid 2.99 $. 
Since US dollar is not your default currency, add `usd` after the expense amount. 
  
  Send `/2.99 usd`
  _Note: mind space between the amount and the currency code_
  
  For the lunch, you ordered a pizza for 5 euro. 
To save this with food category, add üçï after the expense amount. 
  
  Send `/5 üçï`
  _Note: mind space between the amount and the category emoji_
  
  You can find all category emojis by calling /help
  
  *See total*
  
  Call /total. 
  
  You will see the totals for different currencies and categories. 
After some time, you may want to see only current months' total. 
To do so, 
  
  call /month
  
  *Edit expense*
  Now let's say you want to change the category of the mobile app purchase from default to _Fun_. 
To do so, 
  
  go to the message `/2.99 usd` and edit it so that it becomes `/2.99 usd üéâ`
  _Note: mind spaces between the amount, the currency, and the category emoji_
  
  Now call `/total` again
  
  The default category _Any_ under the dollar total should become _Fun_
  
  *Remove expenses*
  
  Call `/clear`
  
  The top option is your last expense. 
Click it to remove and call `/total`
  Now call `/clear` again and choose _All chat_ to clear all expenses. 
Call `/total` to check that you have no expenses anymore
  
  *Set reports*
  
  Call `/reports`
  
  If you want to receive monthly total reports, click the _Monthly_ button
